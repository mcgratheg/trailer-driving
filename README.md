# Simple Vehicle & Trailer Simulation
Two simulations of a vehicle towing a trailer.

First simulation aims to allow user to 'drive' vehicle with keyboard commands to demonstrate responding movement of trailer.

Second simulation aims to demonstrate how weight distribution contributes to incidence of trailer sway when travelling on a straight road at speed.

## Features
* Manipulate front tyres of vehicle with WASD keyboard instructions and watch how the vehicle and trailer respond.
* XC keys will accomodate larger turns of front tyres, AD can be used for more precice turning. C will centre the tyres again.
* Depending on the angle of the front tyres, the trailer can jack-knife when reversing the vehicle, eventually crashing into the rear of the vehicle.

## Features
* Preset values along left-hand side of page with inputs for speed (mph), mass of load (kg), position of centre of mass on the trailer, the total friction on the trailer and the force applied to the trailer.
* Inputs can be changed by user to any reasonable value. Errors displayed for invalid inputs.
* Statistics listed on right-hand side of page.
